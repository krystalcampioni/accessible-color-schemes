# Accessible colour schemes

This project is a prototype on how to allow the user to select a UI colour scheme making sure that the colours have enough contrast between text and background. The goal is to garantee at least [AA acceptance according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)

> This project is far from perfect, and if you see any areas where it could be improved, feel free to submit a pull request ♥️
